## Identify trends and metrics of a sales dataset
In this project, I present findings leveraged from a sales dataset.
* The dataset provided was for a company which sells electronic products.
* As a junior data analyst, the manager asks to me to get trends and metrics of that dataset and present to the team.
* I used tools like Excel, SQL and Power BI to come up actionable insights from this dataset.
* I share with you some useful pictures for that regard.
